# PR Grind — Iterative PR Feedback Resolution

## When to Use

- After `gh pr create` succeeds and you want to stay on it until merge-ready
- When CI is failing on an open PR
- When reviewer comments need addressing
- Manually: `/pr-grind` or `/pr-grind 123` or `/pr-grind https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`

**Announce at start:** "Grinding PR #N — will iterate until CI is green and comments are resolved."

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

| Trap | Why it breaks the loop |
|------|----------------------|
| Collecting feedback while checks are still pending | You'll miss reviewer findings, fix a partial set, push, and trigger a second review cycle unnecessarily |
| Declaring "Round complete" after push without waiting | The push triggers a new review cycle — you must wait for IT to finish before declaring done |
| Only waiting for CI (build/lint/test), ignoring reviewer bots | CodeRabbit, Greptile, Cubic are checks too — `gh pr checks` shows them as pending |
| Fixing pre-existing issues flagged by automated reviewers | Scope creep — only fix issues in YOUR changed code |

## Safety Rails

- **Max iterations:** 5 rounds (override with `--max N`)
- **Autonomous by default:** Grinds without pausing between rounds (override with `--interactive` for human checkpoints)
- **Bail triggers:** Stop immediately and clean up worktree if:
  - A comment is a design/scope question (not a code fix)
  - CI fails on an unrelated flaky test 3 times in a row
  - The fix would require architectural changes
  - Max iterations reached
  - **On any bail:** always run `git worktree remove` before exiting

## Step Details

### Step 0: Create Ephemeral Worktree

Create an isolated worktree so the user's main workspace stays free for their next task.

```bash
# Resolve PR branch name
PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json headRefName -q .headRefName)

# Create worktree in a predictable location
WORKTREE_DIR="../pr-grind-${PR_NUMBER}"
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_DIR" "$PR_BRANCH"

# All subsequent steps run inside the worktree
cd "$WORKTREE_DIR"
```

**Why a worktree:** The roundtable consensus — pr-grind is a different operational mode from the pipeline. Pre-PR phases optimize for local delivery; post-PR grind optimizes for async iteration. An ephemeral worktree gives pr-grind its own branch ownership without hijacking the main workspace or coupling to Phase 6's cleanup lifecycle.

**Skip with `--no-worktree`:** If already on the PR branch (e.g., Phase 6 just created the PR and hasn't cleaned up yet), pass `--no-worktree` to skip worktree creation and work in-place.

### Step 1: Wait for ALL Checks + Reviewers

**DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT proceed while checks are still pending.**

Automated reviewers (CodeRabbit, Greptile, Cubic, CodeScene, GitGuardian) register as GitHub checks. `gh pr checks --watch` blocks until ALL of them complete — not just CI build/lint/test.

```bash
# Phase 1: Wait for all GitHub-registered checks (CI + automated reviewers)
# --watch blocks until every check is pass/fail/skipped — including reviewer bots
timeout 900 gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch 2>&1 || true

# Phase 2: Verify no checks are still pending (defensive — catches race conditions)
# Re-poll in a loop until no pending checks remain (max 5 retries)
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  PENDING=$(gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> 2>&1 | grep -c "pending" || true)
  [ "$PENDING" -eq 0 ] && break
  echo "⏳ $PENDING checks still pending — waiting 60s (attempt $i/5)..."
  sleep 60
done
# Bail if checks are STILL pending after all retries
if [ "$PENDING" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ $PENDING checks still pending after 5 retries. Cannot proceed."
  echo "Remaining: $(gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> 2>&1 | grep pending)"
  exit 1  # Bail — ask user to investigate stuck checks
fi

# Phase 3: Poll for reviewer comments that may arrive after check status flips
# Some reviewers mark their check as "pass" then post comments async
sleep 30  # Grace period for late-arriving comments
```

**Why 3 phases:** `--watch` handles most cases, but some reviewers (e.g., CodeRabbit) mark their check as "pass" and then post inline comments asynchronously. The grace period catches these late arrivals. Without it, you'll collect feedback, fix it, push — and then the reviewer's *real* feedback arrives on the old commit.

If checks are still pending after Phase 1 timeout AND Phase 2 retries, the loop bails with an error listing the stuck checks. The user must investigate before the grind can continue.

### Step 2: Collect Feedback

Gather ALL pending issues in one pass:

```bash
# CI check results
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>

# Inline review comments (REST API returns all — resolved and unresolved)
# Note: REST cannot filter by resolution state. For unresolved-only, use GraphQL:
#   gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner:"OWNER", name:"REPO") {
#     pullRequest(number:N) { reviewThreads(first:100) { nodes {
#       isResolved comments(first:10) { nodes { body path line author { login } } }
#   } } } } }'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.position != null) | {path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, user: .user.login}'

# Review-level comments (approve/request changes/comment)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews \
  --jq '.[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED" or .state == "COMMENTED") | {user: .user.login, state: .state, body: .body}'

# Issue comments (general PR discussion)
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --comments --json comments \
  --jq '.comments[] | {author: .author.login, body: .body}'
```

### Step 3: Triage

Classify each piece of feedback:

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **CI failure — test/lint/build** | Fix it |
| **CI failure — flaky/infra** | Note it, skip after 3 consecutive identical failures |
| **Automated reviewer — specific fix** (CodeRabbit, Greptile, Cubic) | Fix it — treat like human review |
| **Automated reviewer — stale/pre-existing issue** | Skip — only fix issues in YOUR changed code |
| **Human review — specific fix request** | Fix it |
| **Human review — question/clarification** | Reply with explanation, don't change code |
| **Human review — design/scope concern** | **BAIL** — surface to user, this needs human judgment |
| **Code review — nit/style** | Fix it (low effort, high goodwill) |

**Important:** Automated reviewers often post on code that was already in the repo before your PR. Only fix issues in files/lines that YOUR PR changed. If a reviewer flags pre-existing code, note it but don't fix it in this PR.

### Step 4: Fix

For each actionable item:

1. Read the relevant file(s) at the referenced lines
2. Understand the surrounding context
3. Apply the minimal fix that addresses the feedback
4. Do NOT refactor, improve, or "while I'm here" adjacent code

### Step 5: Verify Locally

Run the narrowest test that covers the fix:

```bash
# Detect test runner and run relevant subset
# npm test / pytest / go test / cargo test — scoped to changed files when possible
```

If local tests fail, fix before pushing. Do not push known-failing code.

### Step 6: Commit & Push

```bash
# Stage only the files you changed
git add <specific-files>

# Commit with descriptive message referencing the PR
git commit -m "fix: address PR #<N> feedback — <brief description>"

# Push to the PR branch
git push
```

**BLOCKING GATE:** The `git commit` command will block until the litmus pre-commit review passes. Litmus may auto-iterate up to 10 times to fix issues silently. Do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass this gate. If litmus repeatedly blocks, split the changes into smaller commits.

### Step 7: Checkpoint (only with --interactive)

In autonomous mode (default), log a brief summary and continue immediately to the next round.

In interactive mode (`--interactive`), present to user and wait:

```text
## PR Grind — Round N/MAX complete

**Fixed:**
- [ ] CI: <what failed and how you fixed it>
- [ ] Review: <comment summary and what you changed>

**Skipped:**
- <design questions, flaky tests, etc.>

**Status:** Pushed. CI will re-run.

Continue grinding?
```

## Completion

**All of these must be true before declaring done:**
1. All CI checks passing (build, lint, test)
2. All automated reviewers completed (CodeRabbit, Greptile, Cubic, etc.)
3. No unresolved actionable comments from any source
4. No new comments arrived after your last push (wait for the full cycle)

**Then clean up the worktree:**
```bash
# Return to main worktree
cd <original-worktree-path>

# Remove the ephemeral worktree
git worktree remove "../pr-grind-<PR_NUMBER>" --force
```

```text
## PR Grind Complete

PR #<N> is clean after <rounds> round(s).
- CI: all checks passing
- Automated reviewers: all completed, no actionable findings
- Human comments: all addressed
- Worktree cleaned up.
- Ready for merge.
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `<PR>` | PR number or URL | Auto-detect from current branch |
| `--max N` | Maximum iterations | 5 |
| `--interactive` | Pause for human confirmation each round | Off (autonomous) |
| `--no-worktree` | Skip worktree creation, work in current directory | Off (creates worktree) |
| `--ci-only` | Only fix CI failures, ignore comments | Off |
| `--comments-only` | Only address comments, ignore CI | Off |

## Integration

- **Pairs with:** `finishing-a-development-branch` (Phase 6 creates the PR and cleans up its worktree, then `/pr-grind` creates its own ephemeral worktree for the feedback loop)
- **Worktree lifecycle:** pr-grind owns its worktree from creation to cleanup — independent of the pipeline's Phase 3 worktree. The user's main workspace stays free for new work.
- **Gate:** Litmus pre-commit hook fires on each `git commit` within the loop
- **Agents:** May dispatch `code-reviewer`, `build-error-resolver`, or language-specific reviewers for complex fixes
