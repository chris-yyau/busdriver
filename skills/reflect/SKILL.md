# /reflect — Session Reflection

Analyze mistakes, corrections, and lessons from the current conversation and save them as feedback memories. These are high-trust, always-loaded memories that prevent repeating the same mistakes.

## When to Use

- After you made a mistake and the user corrected you
- After a failed approach that required a different solution
- When the user says "reflect", "remember this", "learn from that"
- After a productive session with lessons worth preserving
- When the user explicitly asks you to save something to memory

## When NOT to Use

- For analyzing tool-use observation logs → handled automatically by ECC v2 observer
- For saving user preferences or project context → use auto-memory directly (the persistent memory system in `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`)
- For inferred behavioral patterns → handled automatically by ECC v2 observer (instincts)

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Lessons

Review the current conversation for:

1. **Corrections** — user rejected your approach and told you to do something differently
2. **Failed approaches** — something didn't work and you had to change strategy
3. **Surprising outcomes** — results you didn't expect that revealed a gap in understanding
4. **Explicit requests** — user said "remember this" or "don't do that again"

For each lesson, draft a feedback memory with:
- **Rule**: what to do (or not do) in the future
- **Why**: the reason behind it (the incident or correction)
- **How to apply**: when this lesson should kick in

### Step 2: Check for Duplicates

Before presenting to the user, check existing memories for overlap:
- Read `~/.claude/notes/NOTES.md` index. If `NOTES.md` does not exist, skip the duplicate check (Step 4 will create it).
- If a similar lesson exists, overwrite the existing file in-place with updated content and update the NOTES.md index entry if the description changed
- If the new lesson contradicts an existing memory, flag it to the user

### Step 3: Present for Confirmation

Show each proposed memory to the user before saving:

```
Proposed memory: [name]
  Rule: [what to do/not do]
  Why: [what happened]
  How to apply: [when this matters]
  Duplicate check: [none found | updating existing: <name>]

Save this? [yes/skip/edit]
```

This confirmation step prevents bad reflections from becoming permanent behavioral distortions. The user can approve, skip, or request edits.

### Step 4: Save Approved Memories

For each approved lesson, write a memory file:

```markdown
---
name: [slug]
description: [one-line — specific enough to judge relevance in future conversations]
type: feedback
last_validated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

[Rule statement]

**Why:** [the incident or correction that prompted this]
**How to apply:** [when/where this guidance kicks in]
```

**Path:** `~/.claude/notes/lesson-reflect-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md`

> **Naming convention:** The `reflect` prefix distinguishes session reflections from other lesson types (`lesson-review-` for code reviews, `lesson-council-` for council sessions; legacy `lesson-roundtable-*.md` files exist from before the council rename and are still indexed in `NOTES.md`).

Then add a one-line pointer to `~/.claude/notes/NOTES.md` (if the file doesn't exist, create it with a `# Notes` header and a `## Reflections` section) using this format:
```
- [Title](./filename.md) — one-line description
```

### Step 5: Report

Show the user:
1. How many lessons identified
2. Which were saved (with names)
3. Which were skipped and why
4. Any duplicates found and updated

## Quality Guidelines

- **<150 words per memory** — if you can't compress it, it's not a single lesson
- **Lead with the rule** — the first line should be actionable
- **Be specific** — "verify symlinks after creation" not "be more careful"
- **Include why** — without context, future-you can't judge edge cases
- **One lesson per file** — don't combine unrelated corrections

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Code patterns or conventions (derivable from codebase)
- Git history details (use `git log`)
- Debugging solutions (the fix is in the code)
- Anything in CLAUDE.md already
- Ephemeral task details
